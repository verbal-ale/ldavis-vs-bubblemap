>**This repository serves as the codebase for the technical implementation of the comparative study part of my Masters Project and Dissertation as well as storage for relevant documentation.** 

In order to evaluate the usability of different forms of topic visualisations, three different interfaces have been produced, each employing a different visualisation strategy to depict the output produced by an LDA topic model.
